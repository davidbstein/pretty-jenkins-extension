# pretty-jenkins-extension

Take ANSI jenkins output and make it look like normal, full colour, console output.


# installation

## If you work with me at Appboy

the CRX will just work if you download it.

## If you don't use the same jenkins instance as me:

 1.  Check out the repo
 2.  in `manifest.json` replace `jenkins.example.com` with the base URI of your jenkins instance
 3.  in chrome, go to `chrome://extensions`, confirm "Developer Mode" is checked, and click "Load Extension"
